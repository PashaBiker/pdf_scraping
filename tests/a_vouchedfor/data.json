I am a Chartered Financial Planner and the Managing Director of Bray Wealth Management which was established in 1984.\n\nOkay, but what do I do?\n\nI look after individuals and their families to help generate, protect and pass on their wealth to the next generation by focusing on them and them only. I like to get to know the real person and what it is they are looking to achieve by asking deep and meaningful questions. Once I feel I know more about the individual and their family, and I feel I can help them, we will then and only then start building their financial plan. Everything we do around financial planning will hinge from this plan and I will be there to guide and coach them through the good and the bad times. I find clients are only concerned with their problems and have little appetite for someone who is only interested in pushing their solutions. \nI believe in building long-term trusted relationships with my clients. I like working with a limited number of key individuals and their families to ensure I can provide them with the right amount time for them to have confidence in their future.\n\nBeing a client means:\n\nYou have a highly qualified professional expert who cares about you and your family.\nYou feel financially well organised and can participate in the relationship.\nYou are committed to the relationship and are willing to be held to account should your behaviour start to compromise your financial plan.\nYou will have the support of a dedicated friendly team who share over 70 years of experience of looking after valued clients.  \n\nI understand that life is short, and time is precious which is why I find it hugely rewarding knowing my clients can go about their daily lives with the knowledge they have a plan and they feel confident about their future.\n\nApproved by The Openwork Partnership on 1st February 2023.",

            "about": "I have been a financial adviser since 1988 and in the past have provided advice in all areas of financial planning including mortgages, protection, pensions and investments. My passion has always been mortgages so I no longer advise on pension or investment planning and I leave this to my colleague and co-director Steve Burgess so I can focus on providing the quality of mortgage advice and service that my clients expect and deserve.\n\nI first started in the industry working for a large financial services company where I had a very successful career and learnt a lot of the skills and knowledge that I still use today. I have now been a dedicated mortgage broker for over 20 years and have had the fortune of helping thousands of clients from all walks of life.\n\nThe advice I provide covers all areas of property finance from first time buyers to professional landlords and everything in between. I get as much satisfaction from helping first time buyers take their first step into property ownership and guiding them through all the options available to them as I do with working with professional landlords and helping them to maximise their profits from their multi-million pound portfolios.  \n\nI always strive to work with the ethos of our company motto - Service, Trust and Knowledge. I aim to provide the very best service that I and my support staff can provide and back this up with my wealth of experience and knowledge gained over many years and continue to gain. Finally my clients can trust in me to provide the right solutions for them in a timely and efficient manner.  \n\nMy spare time tends to revolve around my family, martial arts, football and the odd round of golf when I can find time.\n\nSome buy to let mortgages are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority\n\nYOUR PROPERTY MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE\n\nApproved by The Openwork Partnership on 09/08/2023",
